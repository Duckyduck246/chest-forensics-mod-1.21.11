**GOALS:**   
Finish before 26.1 update?  
In March?  
Do the todo?  
Publish sometime?? ‎   
‎ 


 

**To do:**
-  [ ] Export allContainers to JSON instead of text, OR find a way to reliably parse the text
-  [ ] Make a GUI element in the open containers UI, that displays the missing items??
-  [ ] Store the JSON or TXT file per world/server/dimension (unless I make the containerInfo also contain the dimension in the id?)
-  [ ] Read the JSON or parse the TXT
-  [ ] Make commands to restart the world's JSON/TXT file? /chestforensics reset {tags}
-  [ ] Make commands to ignore chests? /chestforensics ignore all?
-  [ ] Implement the tag system (all opened containers have the "all" tag, they also have default tags for the dimension they are in)
-  [ ] Mark two points as the corner of a rectangular area to apply a tag to it????? Auto tagging???
-  [ ] Chests' outline color change after opening if it has been stolen from??? Or if it is ignored?? Implement a texture pack for that
-  [ ] Highlight changed chest slots
-  [ ] Make config menu???? Or operate entirely with chat text buttons since im lazy??
-  [ ] Detect missing chests and stuff + chat alerts if that happends?
-  [ ] Make mod art and publish maybe??? if i feel like it???
-  [ ] Large history TXT export type thing with all containers and thier histories organized through file folders and TXT files and maybe JSON files?
  
  
**More optional stuff:**
-  [ ] Make aditional textures for barrels and other containers
-  [ ] Add entity container support using thier UUID
-  [ ] Furnace, brewing stand, and non support
-  [ ] Hotkeys?
-  [ ] Connect tags to properties
-  [ ] Splash text easter eggs!!!
-  [ ] Total container changes using commands like /chestforensics snapshot {tags}
